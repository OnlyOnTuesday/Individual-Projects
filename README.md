# Password-Generator

A program written in Python which can generate a variety of passwords

By default, the generator will output a sentence involving a color, an animal, and some sort of adjective or verb 

With the "-n" option put in on the terminal, it will add numbers, randomly deciding if the numbers should be put before, after, or inbetween the words.

With the "-s" option put in on the terminal, it will add special characters, randomly deciding if they should go before, after, or inbetween the words.

There is currently no way to pass both options at the same time however

BUGS:
None known of, just don't pass both terminal options at the same time
