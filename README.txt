# Password-Generator

A program written in Python which can generate a variety of passwords

By default, the generator will output a sentence involving a color, an animal, and some sort of adjective or verb 


With the "-n" option put in on the terminal, it will add numbers, randomly deciding if the numbers should be put before, after, or inbetween the words.


Support will be added soon for passwords with special characters.

BUGS:
Stay tuned for special character support
